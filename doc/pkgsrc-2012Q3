pkgsrc-2012Q3
=============
 
The pkgsrc team is proud to announce the availability of the
pkgsrc-2012Q3 branch.  There are many new packages, and some bug
fixes.  More work has gone into making packages build with clang (as
well as different versions of gcc), and pkgsrc actively maintains
packages, removing unused or abandoned packages, while still adding
new ones.
 
www.pkgsrc.org was converted to a wiki. We hope the contents will be a
bit less static now and keep you better informed about changes in
pkgsrc.
 
Lots of works was done this quarter on DragonFly and SmartOS (Illumos).
DragonFly at last count now boasts 11538 binary packages, while the
latest public bulk build by Joyent reported 9584 binary packages.
Impressive numbers -- congratulations!
 
Numbers of Packages
===================
 
In pkgsrc, there are:
 
12014 total packages
11618 binary packages built with gcc for NetBSD-current/amd64
11374 binary packages built with clang for NetBSD-current/amd64
10875 pkgsrc entries
 
135 packages have been added this quarter
95 packages have been removed this quarter
Around 1280 packages have been updated this quarter
 
These numbers may not compare exactly to other (binary) packaging
systems; some packaging systems split large packages like boost up
into multiple packages, while others keep unused and unbuildable
packages.
 
Compiler Support
================
 
As well as using gcc to compile packages, Joerg Sonnenberger has put
much effort into building packages with clang. At the present time,
11374 packages can be built using clang.

This is also the last branch to contain python25 (it was EOL'd about a
year ago).
 
Other packages scheduled for removal are:
databases/sqlsharpgtk
devel/stlport
textproc/p5-PDF-API2-Simple
misc/p5-Locale-Maketext
lang/pnet*
lang/gcc3-ada
lang/gcc34-ada
 
Pkgsrc-security
===============
One neat feature of pkgsrc is its ability to sort package versions
based on the version numbers.  It's used in audit-packages, to report
on any installed packages which may have security vulnerabilities in
them.  pkgsrc-security@pkgsrc.org maintains lists of vulnerable
packages, along with reference URLs relating to the exposure.  We
thank OBATA Akio, Daniel Horecki, Guillaume Lasmayous, and Tim
Zingelman for their hard work.  Sample output from audit-packages is
shown below:
 
% audit-packages
Package openjpeg-1.5.0nb1 has a arbitrary-code-execution vulnerability, see
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3535

Package of the Quarter
======================
Jorg Sonnenberger suggested clang, for making development fun again.
Alistair Crooks suggested ikiwiki, in honor of the new pkgsrc.org website.
 
Getting pkgsrc
==============
While more information can be found in
        http://www.netbsd.org/docs/pkgsrc/getting.html
 
tar files for pkgsrc, along with checksums, can be found at
        http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/pkgsrc-2012Q3/
 
and anonymous cvs can be used:
        cvs -z3 -q -d anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot checkout -r pkgsrc-2012Q3 -P pkgsrc
 
About pkgsrc
============
pkgsrc is a cross-platform packaging system.  It allows people to
download source, and to build and install binary packages on one or
more platforms.
 
Building packages from source is useful for a number of reasons:
 
+ not only is the provenance of source code checked (by using multiple
checksums), with pkgsrc, the version of source code you are working
with is the same that other developers and users have.
 
+ patches are maintained in a central repository, and, again, are
checked at patch application time by using digests. The patches
which are applied to the sources being built are the same ones which
are known to be used and proved by other pkgsrc users (not necessarily
on the same platform)
 
+ by building from source, all doubts about compilers, build practices
source code cleanliness, and packaging differences are removed. 
Digital signatures of binary packages, while useful in themselves,
only prove certain aspects of binary package provenance.  (pkgsrc has
had signed packages since 2001).
 
+ it may be difficult or impossible to find a pre-built package for
the operating system or architecture
 
+ a pre-built package may have further or conflicting pre-requisites,
which are themselves difficult to find or build. By building everything,
including pre-requisites, a from-source packaging system can ensure
that pre-requisites are present and integrated
 
At the present time, pkgsrc supports 19 platforms
 
        AIX
        BSDOS
        Darwin/Mac OS X
        DragonFly
        FreeBSD
        FreeMiNT
        HPUX
        Haiku
        IRIX
        Interix/SFU/SUA
        Linux
        Minix3
        MirBSD
        NetBSD
        OSF1
        OpenBSD
        QNX
	Solaris/Illumos
        UnixWare
 
Complete dependency and pre-requisite package information is held and
used by the package management software - if packages rely on other
packages to function properly, that pre-requisite will be built,
installed and managed as part of the package installation process. 
Binary packages can be managed using pkgin.
