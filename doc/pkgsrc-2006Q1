The pkgsrc-2006Q1 Branch
========================
 
The pkgsrc developers are very proud to announce the new pkgsrc-2006Q1
branch, which has support for more packages than previous branches. 
As well as updated versions of many packages, the infrastructure of
pkgsrc itself has been improved for better platform and compiler
support, and also for enhanced security.
 
At the same time, the pkgsrc-2005Q4 branch has been deprecated, and
continuing engineering starts on the pkgsrc-2006Q1 branch.
 
Some highlights of the new pkgsrc-2006Q1 branch are:
 
+ many, many packages have been updated to newer versions, to take
advantage of fixes and improved functionality.  This includes
 
	+ firefox-1.5.0.1
	+ gnome-2.12.2
	+ kde-3.5.1
	+ opera-8.52
	+ perl-5.8.7
	+ postgresql 8.1.3
	+ thunderbird-1.5
	+ X.org 6.9
	+ the addition of some pertinent bright, shiny packages such
	  as apache-tomcat-5.5.14, cdrtools, nagios, qt4, strace,
	  sunbird, and suse 10 packages better to support Linux
	  emulation. 
	+ a considerable number of fixes for much better DragonFly BSD
	  operation, which will also benefit a lot of pkgsrc platforms,
	  with thanks to Joerg Sonnenberger
 
The full list of platforms supported by pkgsrc is:  AIX, BSD/OS,
Darwin (Mac OS X), DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD, IRIX, Interix, Linux, NetBSD,
OSF1, OpenBSD, SunOS (Solaris), and UnixWare.  We would like to add
support for more - please get in touch if you, too, are interested.
 
+ following DragonFly BSD's adoption of pkgsrc as their packaging
system, Joerg Sonnenberger has made a lot of changes, which include a
number of modifications for packages which use POSIX threading
libraries, and also enhanced support for gcc 3.4 and above
 
+ a number of changes in pkgsrc's infrastructure have been introduced,
including improvements in the PLIST handling, the ongoing work to
validate PLISTs automatically, especially during bulk builds, and the
improvements in the pkginstall framework, most noticably
font-handling.
 
+ continuing engineering on the "stable" branches of pkgsrc has been
much improved, and our thanks to the pkgsrc releng team for all the
hard work they do in sanity checking pullup requests, and managing
the stable branches in pkgsrc
 
+ constant bulk building on a number of platforms has improved our
ability to identify potential areas of concern, and to correct them
sooner.  It has also improved our ability to make binary packages
available, and we are working on ways to improve this further.  For
more information, please refer to the pkgsrc-bulk mailing list,
archives available at
 
	http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-bulk/
 
+ the number of packages has been increased to 5943; the number of
supported platforms continues to be 13.  NetBSD, on all its supported
architectures, is considered to be one pkgsrc platform.
 
As always, we'd like to encourage users of the packages collection to
install and run pkgsrc/security/audit-packages at least every day -
this will provide notification of any packages which are vulnerable
to exploit.
 
We'd also really appreciate it if people would install the
pkgsrc/pkgtools/pkgsurvey package, and then run the pkgsurvey script
for us.  This will forward us a list of the packages installed on that
machine, and the operating system and release level of the operating
system.  The results will be kept confidential, but the output will
help us analyse the packages that are most used.
 
The source tar files for the new branch can be found at:

You can also use the "pkgsrc-2006Q1" tag to check it out yourself from
anoncvs.NetBSD.org or any of the mirrors.
