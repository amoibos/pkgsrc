Fix for compiling on Solaris SPARC with gcc.

If __sparcv8 is defined, use the SPARC v8 version of udiv_qrnnd.  Without
this change, udiv_qrnnd will not be defined using the SPARC v8 udiv
instruction, and the default SPARC v7 case of defining it to be the native
__gmpn_udiv_qrnnd will be used, but this does not exist on SPARC v8, so
at link time, the user will get an error about _gmpn_udiv_qrnnd being
undefined.  gcc defines __sparcv8.

From PR pkg/26815.
