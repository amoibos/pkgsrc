* It's true Mach-O systems aren't supported by
  ${WRKSRC}/content/media/gstreamer/GStreamerLoader.cpp so
  $(GSTREAMER_LIBS) must be directly appended to $(EXTRA_DSO_LDOPTS)
  on such platforms. The problem is that "ifeq
  (cocoa,$(MOZ_WIDGET_TOOLKIT))" ain't the right thing to do when
  testing for Mach-O is what we need.
